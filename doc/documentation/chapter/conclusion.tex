\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

The goal of this project was to develop a web interface for controlling an ABB ventilation controller. The final interface is able to display all available information about the connected ventilation system including live sensor data as well as former measurement results. Not only does the interface display those values in two plots, but the user can also switch between different time intervals. Both automatic and manual modes are working and allow the user to set a target pressure or fan speed. 

Next to the control panel, the settings page allows users to see their login activity, reset their password or add new users. Additionally, the help page provides helpful information about all important features of the web interface. Not only are all features implemented and working without any known problems, but also does the web interface come in a very intuitive and consistent design.\\

To sum up, all requirements to the web interface have been met and the final product allows users to control a ventilation system nicely and easily.
